# Architecture Exception Configuration
#
# This file defines which component/architecture combinations should be marked
# as "N/A" (not applicable) rather than empty in the architecture support table.

# Accelerator to CPU architecture incompatibility rules
#
# When a component name contains an accelerator keyword AND is not built for
# a CPU architecture listed here, it will be marked as N/A instead of empty.
#
# Rationale:
# - ROCm: AMD GPU technology, not available on ARM64, ppc64le, or s390x
# - CUDA: NVIDIA GPU technology, not available on ppc64le or s390x
# - Gaudi: Intel Gaudi accelerator, only supports x86_64/amd64
# - Spyre: Accelerator technology, only supports x86_64/amd64
# - CPU: CPU-only workloads are compatible with all architectures

# Specific component/architecture exceptions
#
# Use this section to track specific component/architecture combinations that
# cannot be built due to specific issues or limitations.
#
# Fields:
# - component: The component name (as it appears in output-image)
# - architectures: List of architectures affected by this exception
# - reason: Human-readable explanation (for documentation, not shown in output)
# - issue: Jira issue URL tracking this limitation (optional)
#          If provided, the issue key will be shown in the table output
#          If omitted, "XXX" will be shown as a placeholder
#
# Note: Exception entries show the issue key or "XXX" in the table,
#       while accelerator_incompatibility_rules show "N/A"
#
# Example:
# [[exception]]

# architectures = ["ppc64le", "s390x"]
# reason = "Vendor library not available on these architectures"
